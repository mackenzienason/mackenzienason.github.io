            <h1>Navigation Redesign</h1>
            <h2 class="subhead">Accessing the right info at the right time</h2>
        </div>
        <p>With a growing backlog of features and improvements, the Odds app needed to address some key navigational issues that had become evident from user feedback and analytics research.<br><br>
          Users weren’t accessing the info they wanted and action/conversion funnels were performing at a very low rate, leading us to believe that there was some ambiguity to the interface and navigation structure.<br><br>
          My role was to address pain points of navigation for the current and forecasted experience.  </p>

          <h2>Research takeaways</h2>
          <h3 class="subhead"><strong>0.07%</strong> of users place a bet despite <strong>35.54%</strong> of users clicking on the bet button</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:24px">The previous experience didn’t offer a way to set up accounts easily in the onboarding phase and we didn’t promote quick betting within the app - as a key feature.<br><br>
            The team identified the issue as a lack of exposure/ trust for the user. To combat it we decided to focus on educating and onboarding users to make the experience familiar and frictionless.</p>
          <h3 class="subhead" style="margin-top:24px"><strong>26%</strong> of users click through to a sports hub after viewing sport selector screen</h3>
          <p style="margin-top:24px">Based on our knowledge of website and apps analytics and user feedback, we knew that users were directly seeking specific information about leagues/ events rather than the top level sport category.<br><br>
            We needed to change navigation to fit the behaviours of our audience. Our solution was to change leagues as the main navigation method, with the ability to search through leagues and sports; With a future outlook of offering team, and player based search and personalisation functionality.

          <h2>Simplifying the tab menu</h2>
          <p>The final point of contention was the tab menu, our previous solution didn't allow for expansion of our offering. The solution that was suggested was the use of a more tab, ordering things based on their popularity and combining some screens to clear ambiguity.</p>
